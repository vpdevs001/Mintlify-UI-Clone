Hey bro (whoever is reviewing this assignment) here is the image of the final website that i made: <a target="_blank" href="https://mintlify-clone.netlify.app/" alt="Mintlify">Visit My Website</a>

There are some bugs that you might see so i am clarifying them first:

<h1>Navbar Bug</h1>

You might have noticed that on the Mintlify Website when you get past to the Hero Section the Navbar colors get swaped like black color becomes white and white becomes black but in my website you will not see that functionality becuase there is no way to that without using **JavaScript** So, kindly ignore that.

Notice in the repo i have added an image with the name **Final-Output.png**
